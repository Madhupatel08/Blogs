## Process:-
The first step was to register at the Dare2Compete website for this program, where basic details were asked like College name and branch etc. The main selection criterion was a coding test consisting of two questions, which was conducted on the Dare2Compete platform and had a medium to difficult level. For me, one question was on binary Search and the other one on Graphs.  One should try to solve both questions; however, selection ultimately depends on the level of difficulty of the questions. In my case, I was only able to solve one out of the two questions, yet I still received a selection email. Nonetheless, the selection is based on relative performance compared to other applicants.

After a few days of the test, A list of selected students was shared by the TNP cell. Out of more than 5000 applications, I was happy to be chosen as one of the cohort's 200 students. Then, an orientation was hosted by the Flipkart team, where the structure of the program was discussed, and tech talks from industry leaders.

We were then introduced to our mentors.  Each group of four students was assigned one or two mentors, who were working professionals from Flipkart. We had regular meetings with the mentors to discuss the industry, practice DSA questions, and clear doubts. 

The program was divided into four modules, each with sessions every one or two weeks. Sessions were interactive and included breakout rooms for discussion and problem-solving. Doubt sessions were also conducted between the modules. Along with regular sessions, mock interviews were also arranged with mentors, which proved to be highly beneficial.

After each module, a test was conducted, and there was a final test to assess students' understanding of the topics. Based on their performance on the final test, students were given interview opportunities. I was able to solve 3 out of 4 questions, thanks to the helpful DSA sessions conducted by the program. This achievement brought me a sense of satisfaction, and I got an interview opportunity.

The program provided an opportunity to upskill DSA skills with the guidance of excellent mentors and the chance to interview with Flipkart. The overall experience was highly satisfying, with cool goodies as an added bonus.

## Perks:-
Opportunity to be a part of a prestigious cohort of selected students
Opportunity for PPIs and internships
Cool goodies:))
